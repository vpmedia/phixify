# Clean Code

These rules guide code generation to produce maintainable, professional-quality code.

## Meaningful Names
- Use intention-revealing names that explain why something exists
- Avoid disinformation and meaningless distinctions (e.g., `data`, `info`, `manager`)
- Use pronounceable, searchable names
- Class names: nouns (e.g., `UserAccount`, `PaymentProcessor`)
- Method names: verbs (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `sendEmail`)
- Avoid mental mapping and encodings (Hungarian notation, prefixes)

## Functions
- Keep functions small (< 20 lines ideal)
- Do one thing only - Single Responsibility Principle
- One level of abstraction per function
- Limit arguments: 0-2 ideal, 5 maximum, avoid flag arguments
- No side effects - function should do what its name says
- Separate commands (change state) from queries (return info)
- Prefer exceptions over error codes

## Comments
- Code should be self-explanatory - avoid comments when possible
- Good comments: legal info, warnings, TODOs, public API documentation
- Bad comments: redundant, misleading, or explaining bad code
- Never comment out code - delete it (version control preserves history)
- If you need a comment, consider refactoring the code instead

## Formatting
- Keep files small and focused
- Vertical formatting: related concepts close together, blank lines separate concepts
- Horizontal formatting: limit line length (80-120 characters)
- Use consistent indentation and team style
- Group related functions together

## Objects and Data Structures
- Objects: hide data behind abstractions, expose behavior through methods
- Data structures: expose data, have minimal behavior
- Law of Demeter: only talk to immediate friends, avoid `a.getB().getC().doSomething()`
- Don't expose internal structure through getters/setters blindly

## Error Handling
- Use exceptions, not return codes or error flags
- Write `try-catch-finally` first when code might fail
- Provide context in exception messages
- Don't return `null` - return empty collections or use Optional/Maybe
- Don't pass `null` as arguments

## Classes
- Small classes: measured by responsibilities, not lines
- Single Responsibility Principle: one reason to change
- High cohesion: class variables used by many methods
- Low coupling: minimal dependencies between classes
- Open/Closed Principle: open for extension, closed for modification

## Unit Tests
- Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely (F.I.R.S.T.)
- One assert per test (or one concept)
- Test code quality equals production code quality
- Readable test names that describe what's being tested
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

## Code Quality Principles
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: No duplication
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't build for hypothetical futures
- **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Boy Scout Rule**: Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Code Smells to Avoid
- Long functions or classes
- Duplicate code
- Dead code (unused variables, functions, parameters)
- Feature envy (method more interested in other class)
- Inappropriate intimacy (classes knowing too much about each other)
- Long parameter lists
- Primitive obsession (overusing primitives instead of small objects)
- Switch/case statements (consider polymorphism)
- Temporary fields (class variables only used sometimes)

## Concurrency
- Keep concurrent code separate from other code
- Limit scope of synchronized/locked data
- Use thread-safe collections
- Keep synchronized sections small
- Know your execution models and primitives

## System Design
- Separate construction from use (dependency injection)
- Use factories, builders for complex object creation
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Apply design patterns when they simplify, not to show off

## Refactoring
- Refactor continuously, not in big batches
- Always have passing tests before and after
- Small steps: one change at a time
- Common refactorings: Extract Method, Rename, Move, Inline

## Documentation
- Self-documenting code > comments > external docs
- Public APIs need clear documentation
- Include examples in documentation
- Keep docs close to code (ideally in code)

---

**Core Philosophy**: Code is read 10x more than written. Optimize for readability and maintainability, not cleverness.
